# Changelog

-- small update: codebase moved to c99 instead of gnu99 

- Dependencies to X have been added back (but are not needed if you disable the modules in the config and edit the makefile).
These dependencies were for the display size and refresh rate modules. 

You will still need the libpci dependency to get GPU detection.



- Codebase sorting mostly complete.

This means starting to get rid of bugs and security issues, 

whilst making the code more readable. The project's 

code style guidelines will be posted if requested.
