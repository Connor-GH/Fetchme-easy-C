# CONTRIBUTING.md

Thank you for considering contributing to fetchme.


Unsure how to begin contributing? 
Here is how to get started: https://makeapullrequest.com/

Contributing in most cases helps to speed up the development process of the project, as I cannot work on it full time.

There are many ways to contribute, from improving the documentation, submitting bug reports, and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into the project.

Please check for duplicate issues before you post yours.

## Responsibilities

   - Ensure *NIX compatibility for every change that's accepted. BSDs and Linux are the focus here.
   - Ensure that code that gets merged meets all requirements listed throughout this document.
   - Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make.
   - Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.


Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors are fine to do in a PR as long as it is worthwhile (more than just one spelling mistake).
# Examples of small contributions:

  - Spelling / grammar fixes
  - Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
  - Comment clean up
  - Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
  - Adding logging messages or debugging output
  - Moving source files from one directory or package to another

[//]:  # "If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email <this will be added soon> instead."
(You can open an issue currently, but this will be changed in the future.)

Lastly, 
## When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

   - What version of GCC/Linux are you using (``gcc -v && uname -r``)?
   - What processor architecture are you using?
   - What did you do?
   - What did you expect to see?
   - What did you see instead? 
## At this point, you're ready to make your changes!
