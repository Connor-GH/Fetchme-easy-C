# This doc gives information as to what distros work best, work okay, and what isn't mentioned should be assumed to not work at all.

## Fully-working distros: 
- Arch Linux
- Artix Linux
- (theoretically) any Arch-based distributions

## Okay-working distros:
(No package count but otherwise no problems):

- Gentoo
- Debian/Ubuntu-based distros
- Void
- OpenSUSE
- Solus

## Haven't tested (planned in the future):

(These changes will require some time to adjust
functions to be more POSIX-compliant alternatives)

- FreeBSD
- MacOS
