# This doc gives information as to what distros work best, work okay, and what isn't mentioned should be assumed to not work at all.

## Fully-working distros: 
- any Pacman-based distributions (Arch, Artix tested)
- any Portage-based distributions (Gentoo tested)

## Okay-working distros:
(No package count but otherwise no problems):

- Debian/Ubuntu-based distros
- Void
- OpenSUSE
- Solus

(no cpu, mem, uptime, or disk info);
- FreeBSD


## Haven't tested (planned in the future):

(These changes will require some time to adjust
functions to be more POSIX-compliant alternatives)

- MacOS
