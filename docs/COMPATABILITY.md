# This doc gives information as to what distros work best, work okay, and what isn't mentioned should be assumed to not work at all.

## Fully-working distros:
- any Pacman-based distributions (Arch, Manjaro-ARM, Artix tested)
- any Portage-based distributions (Gentoo tested)
- any apk-based distributions (Alpine tested)

## Okay-working distros:
(No package count):

- Debian/Ubuntu-based distros
- Void
- OpenSUSE
- Solus

(no mem or disk info);
- FreeBSD
- OpenBSD


## Haven't tested (planned in the future):
