# Changelog

- Dependencies to X have been removed (temporarily due to resource concerns and compatability). 

These dependencies were for the screen size information function, which is in development to be more portable. 

If no portable solution exists, it will be removed permanently.



- Codebase sorting started.

This means starting to get rid of bugs and security issues, 

whilst making the code more readable. The project's 

code style guidelines will be posted if requested.
